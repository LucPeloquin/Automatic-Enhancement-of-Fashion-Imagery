You can run this program in 1 of 2 ways

1. run the ui.py file (with the libraries installed)
2. run the ui.exe file as administrator in the dist directory

The folder input has a full dataset of 100 png files.
Alternatively, the in folder has a sample size of 11 images that takes less time to compile.

For ui.py, here are the libraries you need.

Requirements:
Python 3.12
libraries:
    plyer
    opencv-python
    numpy
    rembg

This application only accepts .jpg, .jpeg, and .png as valid inputs

dist/ui/ui.exe is the standalone exe version (does not require library or python installation)
ui.exe works best when ran in administrator mode
ui.exe takes a second to open, please try again if it doesnt work the first time or wait 20 seconds

ui.py is the interface file
main.py is the algorithm file
dist/ui/ui.exe is the path for the standalone application

in is a datset of 11
input is a dataset of 100
output is the processed input (100 pngs) dataset
